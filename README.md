# Rollerblade Sonification Simulator

## Introduction

The Rollerblade Sonification Simulator is a project aimed at enhancing the rollerblade skater's experience by providing real-time auditory feedback while skating, with a focus on injury prevention and mastering the correct positions for optimal technique. This user guide serves as documentation for the simulator, explaining its features, controls, and scenarios.

## Features

- Real-time auditory feedback through programmatic sound waves.
- Alerts for incorrect leg positions (top right/left, bottom right/left, and side right/left).
- Sonification strategies using background music to indicate leg placement, midline closeness, and rolling off path.
- Three scenarios: Rolling straight, Rolling uphill, and Rolling around cones.
- User-friendly interface with controls for volume adjustment and muting feedback.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Rolling Straight

In this scenario, the user goes straight, and the simulator provides alerts when incorrect leg positions are used (anything except top right/left).

### Scenario 2: Rolling Uphill

During uphill skating, the simulator uses bottom and top leg positions, issuing alerts if incorrect positions are detected. Leg placement is crucial for effective uphill technique, and the simulator provides a "paneer" effect for sound based on leg placement.

### Scenario 3: Rolling Around Cones

This scenario focuses on weaving cones with outward and inward leg positions. Only side leg positions are considered accurate, and leg placement and "midline closeness" play key roles. The slider for midline closeness affects sound frequencies.

## User Interface

The user interface is straightforward, with a "Try It" option to unhide all controls, such as leg positions generating different sounds. Users can mute the interface, adjust volume, and utilize the "rolling off" slider to stay on track. Display elements include total alerts and time since starting a specific scenario.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Rollerblade Sonification Simulator on your preferred web browser.
3. Start the simulation by selecting a scenario and using the controls to improve your rollerblading skills.
